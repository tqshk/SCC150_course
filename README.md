The task1 for this practical is to write an assembler program which can multiply two integer numbers.
(not use the mult instruction, Instead, the program should perform the multiplication using the Ethiopian Multiplication.
Multiplication of two numbers is achieved using shift operations and simple addition.)

The task2 is to develop a MIPS Emulator in c, supporting a limited number of instructions. 
The Emulator convert the following instructions into bytecode: NOP, ADD, ADDI, ANDI, SRL, SLL, BEQ, BNE.
